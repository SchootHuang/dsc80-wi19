    "\n",
    "-  **. (a period)** -- matches any single character except newline '\\n'\n",
    "- **\\w** -- (lowercase w) matches a \"word\" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. **Note that although \"word\" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word**. \\W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\s** -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \\n\\r\\t\\f]. \\S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\t, \\n, \\r** -- tab, newline, return\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\d** -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support but \\d, but they all support \\w and \\s)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **^ = start, $ = end** -- match the start or end of the string\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\** -- inhibit the \"specialness\" of a character. So, for example, use \\. to match a period or \\\\ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \\@, to make sure it is treated just as a character."
